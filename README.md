# Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In the case of the CRUD Python module, this is one module that accesses a database and performs basic functions on the data there. This module could be used for more purposes than just the dashboard, reducing redundant code. Quality code will follow industry best standards, have helpful comments, and is written in the most clear way possible.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems as a computer science by trying to cut them into smaller, more manageable pieces. Building an entire dashboard seems daunting, but when you break it down into smaller work: connect to the database, build your queries, build the service, put it all together; it seems more manageable.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists provide people with the functionality that they need to make their lives easier. In this case, that meant building a way for Grazioso Salvare to be able to quickly see what dogs are available so they don't have to waste time searching for all that manually. Users come up with the idea "What if there was a way to...." but computer scientists make it happen.
